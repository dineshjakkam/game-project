USER INSTRUCTIONS:
There is a mouse driven event which helps in highlighting the object to shoot. Once focusing on the object, click mouse button to shoot. There is a timer that is running behind and you need to shoot all objects in the given time. 

Note:
The aim of this project is to learn the fundamentals in Java. Programming fundamentals and concepts like oops, Strings, Arrays, GUI, Simple Event-Driven programming are learnt and used in developing the game. 

The template is provided with online course material at www.edx.org with the images, background music required for the game.

The display of players log and highscore table is also coded (source code available in project folder highscore view file) but I have to take proper measures to make it work correctly at the end. 

Thank you so much for your time.
